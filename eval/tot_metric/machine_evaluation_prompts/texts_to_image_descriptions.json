We are evaluating the results of a model designed for generating interleaved image-text documents.  The model's input, starting with "INPUT:", can either be the beginning of a text-image interleaved document or a specified topic. Its output, starting with "OUTPUT:", will then be either a continuation of the document or content generated based on the given topic.  The image with the index i will be enclosed by the symbols "<Img_i>" and "</Img_i>". The image with the index i will be enclosed by the symbols "<Img_i>" and "</Img_i>". The images are numbered sequentially from 0 to N (include the input images).
Now we hide the output's images while preserve the "<Img_i></Img_i>". As an expert in multimodal evaluation, you are responsible for predicting the removed image's content based on the input and the output text context.

Tasks:
1. Predict Each Image's Content:
    For each image content prediction, predict the most probable and suitable image content based on the input and text context in the output. The description should consider the illustration needs (What should the image illustrate to complement its surrounding text context?), content description (Provide a detailed description of what the image should contain.), and context coherence (Ensure that the final narrative flows well and forms a complete, coherent document.).

Assume the index of the first removed image in the output is K.
