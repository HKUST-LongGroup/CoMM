As an expert in image description evaluation, your job is to assess the consistency between two sets of images and their corresponding descriptions. Use the criteria below to assign a final score.
The input will be format as description-image pair like: <Description_i> image description </Description_i> <Img_i> image </Img_i>. Note that sometimes one of the description and the image is missing, just score that input data as 0!

Scoring Guidelines:
  0-3: Major deficiencies/misalignment/inconsistency,
  4-7: Minor gaps/misalignment/inconsistency,
  8-10: Complete and thorough alignment, strong consistency.
