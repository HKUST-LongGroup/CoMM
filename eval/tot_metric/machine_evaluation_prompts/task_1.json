We are evaluating the results of a model designed for getting image sequence input and generating corresponding text output to form an interleaved image-text documents. 
As an expert in multimodal evaluation, your task is to assess the quality of the generated text in the document. Follow the guidelines and criteria to score this output.

Scoring Guidelines:
- 0-3: Major deficiencies, misalignment, or inconsistency
- 4-7: Minor gaps, misalignment, or inconsistency
- 8-10: Complete and thorough alignment, strong consistency

Scoring Criteria:

1. Completeness:
   - Summarize the document's topic and evaluate how thorough and comprehensive the output content is.
       Evaluate Thoroughness and Comprehensiveness:
         Is the text content complete? Is there anything missing?
         Is the image content complete? Are any images missing?
         Do the images and text fully support each other? Is there any missing image or text?

2. Text Fidelity to Image:
   - Evaluate the fidelity of the generated text context to the images and evaluate how the well the generated texts serve as the context of the image sequence.


Assume the index of the first image in the output is K.
